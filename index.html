<p>The goal of this web site is to communicate in a concise objective fashion information about OUR CFT. Please eMail comments for improvements or questions.</p>
<h2 id="cft-current-situation">CFT current situation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately the CFT so far has not been administered in the manner it was intended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stanley has refused to forward me records of what he has been involved in with trust properties since he became co-trustee. His communication style with me is unidirectional and sparse at best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only activity I have been able to conduct on behalf of the trust was to coordinate getting a lawyer for the trust and saving 35th avenue from foreclosure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stanley and I as co-trustees have failed to get any rental income from the Balboa property which Johnson has occupied as was Mom’s request when she appointed us as co-trustees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stanley has vacated the 8th avenue property of renters so that it has now has no discernible income and is easier to sell under SF rent control laws. Any income it did produce since Stanley and I became co-trustees he has spent without informing me of details. Stanley has moved other people into 8th avenue without informing the me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After spending trust monies to improve 8th avenue Stanley has tried to negotiate a low ball offer to buy the half of 8th avenue the CFT owns with Johnson but he has not involved me in those negotiations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Johnson has so far not moved on the will or probate or any audit activities that I am aware of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was able to find a lawyer who worked for the CFT to save 35th avenue from foreclosure in the nick of time. The trust now owns both the lawyer and Stanley for the amounts required to stop said foreclosure. The foreclosure stemmed from a loan it appears Johnson and Mom administered against 35th ave to improve the property he occupies on Balboa. The loan remains unpaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been no probate activity since Mom’s death, Johnson seems to have control of the will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a large insurance policy that pays out to the trust. I do not feel comfortable making those funds available from the policy until the family has come to agreement on the resolution of the CFT. The reason I do not feel comfortable making those funds available is because of the appearance of self dealing relative to trust properties in the very recent past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Johnson is not legally a co-trustee of the CFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CFT currently has debts accumulating and properties not being attended to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self dealing activities such as vacant properties and occupation with no rent has had a great direct cost to the trust as well as massive opportunity costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Johnson has shared that a lawyer has informed him Mom may have out lived the purpose of the trust. This, if it true, would allow dissolution of the trust, but would need to be decided in court. That would invalidate the education trust stipulations as well. It would also influence the consequences of estate settlement especially relative to the will we have yet to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a co-trustee, I do not agree that Mom outlived the purpose of the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action must be taken to resolve the estate and issues of the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust owns 2.5 rental properties in San Francisco, a great deal of stocks and subsequent income of said stocks as well as it should benefit directly from the proceeds of the insurance policy and other accounts that may exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Naturally my goal is to preserve family harmony and avoid combative litigation but also to honor Mom and Dad’s trust intentions as much as possible while adjudicating the trust JUSTLY for the entire family. I do not believe that some should benefit more than others including Peter, Grace and Chanan. I believe now that it would be best to facilitate a distribution and resolution of the trust in the most straight forward way possible.</p>
<p>Although I am not pleased with the obvious self dealing that has taken place relative to CFT assets and believe there should be some restitution to the family for those activities I see it will be very difficult to litigate. I am not saying there was malicious intention here but the law is very clear as self dealing and the trust beneficiary rights. you will find details here:</p>
<p>I propose that to resolve all of this justly to the ENTIRE family as equally as possible we accomplish the following. We liquidate the trust assets and appoint a fiduciary and use a lawyer or mediator to accomplish the following:</p>
<h3 id="cft-distribution-proposal">CFT distribution proposal:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid obvious conflicts of interest I suggest that the trust be adjudicated not by any family members but by a professional fiduciary / lawyer at the trusts expense. I would like to have a legal team act to adjudicate the trust going forward, not any family members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mom and Dad wanted the properties to fund an education trust for at least the next two to three decades. Lawyers have informed me that this makes little sense as drafted especially with a 5 to 6 million dollar estate. So I want to suggest to the family we resolve the trust in a facilitated manner yet with some consideration of education funding for generation 3 and beyond even if we can not be exact per my parents instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have asked some lawyers to review the Trust and they believe it is not well written and awkward at best to administer. Some lawyers have shared that the trust was not out lived but is definitely not well written or structured. They are preparing best price quotes to resolve the trust WITHOUT LITIGATION. A problem is that as written the generation 2 family members could mostly all be dead before any distribution of assets. They also find the education trust aspect to be very very difficult to administer as written. Since it can’t be easily professionally administered “as drafted” by a third party appointed by the court without great difficulty and expense I suggest a reasonable settlement approach as listed below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We must prevent any self dealing with trust assets going forward. All activities must be transparent and documented to the entire family at least through generation 3 beneficiaries. The fiduciary / lawyer can accomplish this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust could benefit from an audit to ascertain damages done especially since 2015 when co-trustees were established. An audit has been requested by several family members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An audit can find out if there are more accounts that Johnson and Mom co-opened that may have CFT monies in them. It seems there were co-mingled accounts Johnson has used for his own personal expenses. These amounts and the opportunity cost of lost rental revenue from the Balboa property could also be estimated. I would like to audit Stanley’s actions since 2015. In essence the same can be said of the 8th avenue property as the Balboa property: they both have experienced direct and opportunity cost losses. Direct and opportunity costs could be established to see how much the CFT lost to self dealing activities. I will propose below a way for the CFT to recover it’s losses from self dealing (again not assigning malicious intent just the amount of loss).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must make some funds liquid in order to pay the Trust’s bills and taxes but keep them safe from potential self dealing. We must get the properties in shape and producing revenue ASAP. Both the 2943 Balboa property and the 1867-1869 8th Avenue property must pay rent to the CFT from the occupants of said properties. We must also provide some funds to clean up the 610 35th Avenue property and get that ready for rental. I would like to, effective immediately or as soon as possible, collect rental income from all of the properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the 3rd party is in place and a audit done (if we decide to) the lawyers suggest it is best to sell all the properties now for the highest possible market value. This is because every lawyer I have talked to seems to think the Trust is too unreasonable to function as written. Stanley can offer to buy half of 8th Ave at highest market value for cash payment only (no loans from the trust as he has proposed in the past). The lawyers believe it best to just close the trust out and accommodate the education trust intentions as a part of the CFT adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the family’s approval I suggest the estate be distributed into 10 equal shares as close to trust intentions as possible but with a couple exceptions as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I believe it is just and legal to include Peter, Grace and Canaan as equal participants with the other G2 children despite the reduced amounts mentioned in the trust. If the trust were to be by law distributed they would get equal shares. This equates to 8 equal shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alisha and Rachel will get Helen s share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the 8 generation 2 shares there would be two additional equal shares ofr a total of 10 equal shares: 1. for the grandchildren (generation 3) and one to be distributed as education funds back to the generation 2 families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grandchildren s share would be distributed equally to the grandchildren.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education share would be equally distributed to the generation 2 beneficiaries ear marked for education use by that family. The generation 2 families would be free to distribute the education share as they see fit for education purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To account for the self dealing I propose that the education share of Johnson and Stanley be reabsorbed into the main education share and equally distributed to the generation 2 families. This may not seem fair as the direct and opportunity costs to the trust far exceed this amount but it is something. Johnson, due to having no children would not have participated in the education trust anyway, so his claw back is actually very small indeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe the education trust sections are poorly drafted legally and may not be reasonable to follow but I did want to establish some way to provide for the wishes of my parents. Hence I suggested the above so that some portion of trust assets be would indeed be identified to be used for education funds for the issue of my Parents. Each of the gen 2 families can use the honor system to use the funds as ear marked as they see fit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also the matter of Mom’s will, despite my husband’s informing Johnson of the 30 day probate period, he has not yet shown the family this document. He has claimed to my sister, Marian, that Mom had willed him the 35th Avenue property. I anticipate other surprises. We talked about having a neutral legal representative read the will to the family in case of the need for interpretation. Probate also needs to be conducted for CFT business as many accounts the CFT will need to use require probate to move forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until a fiduciary is established I propose that Stan use the Charles Schwab account to liquidate only enough funds to maintain the properties. I believe we can trust Stan do accomplish this going forward because this use of funds must be fully accounted for and copied to the entire family as we move forward. Stan can pay the lawyer and himself for the foreclosure activities and also property tax, insurance etc… as he recently told me he desires to do. Since I live in Washington and not locally I as of yet have not spent any CFT funds and let Stanley act in that capacity so I intend to maintain that so that the audit is much easier to conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Johnson has the will he should start probate and inform the entire family of the proceeds as required by law. We will need letters of administration form the probate court for the CFT to move forward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="restitution-considerations">Restitution considerations</h2>
<p>Finally please deeply consider our ability to re-mediate the self dealing which has bled trust assets over the years. I know that this is a loving family and we as a whole avoid conflict and wrong doing. The beneficiaries have requested an audit to ascertain damage to the trust, which I have been pressing for, but to no avail without my brothers’ cooperation. We would need to do an audit at least since 2016 to ascertain the value of lost rents and the direct use of funds that has occurred. I do believe the audit can clearly illuminate the extent of the self dealing. This effort however causes me to consider the cost and trauma of a litigation to claw back loss for the CFT and the family once they are established. If we take legal action to articulate and to claw back the losses of the trust the lawyers tell me it would be very expensive. Should those who are found to have conducted self dealing decide to litigate or avoid payment it will become even more expensive and lengthy. Also there may be little to no chance of recovering what was taken, expended or lost due to opportunity costs via direct collections because the folks involved could become judgement proof. To that end it will be more judicious to ask the court to carve out what would have come into the Trust from those estimated losses then the CFT can attach the inheritance share of the individual for those amounts The recovery would be redistribute to the other heirs / beneficiaries of the CFT.</p>
